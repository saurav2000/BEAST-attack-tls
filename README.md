# BEAST-attack-tls
## Running the code
- To run the code use the command `sh run_all.sh`
- The above command works on Ubuntu 18.0.4. If it is does not work / if the code is being run on mac
  Open 3 terminals and run `python3 bank.py` on one, `python3 attacker.py` on another and `python3 victim.py` on the last.
- **Remember to run the bank first, attacker next and victim last**
- **P.S. The `terminal.sh` is a hack to open a new terminal without closing after the process is done and is unrelated to the attack.**
